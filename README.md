# PDFs_merger
This python file is able to merge PDF files. It can either merge 
1) all files in the directory 
2) the desired files that we choose in a specific order one by one manually through output on the terminal.

This takes help of PyPDF2 which is a Python library for working with PDF documents.

Few helpful resources for possible future updates for the project:
